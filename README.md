Spinner is a companion library for the wonderful
[Fidget](https://github.com/treeform/fidget) that makes creating beautiful UIs faster
without sacrificing customizability. Begone, ugly native components!

Existing components include:
- Toggle switches
- Sliders
- Buttons
- Checkboxes
- Radio buttons
- Progress bars

...with more to come! (PRs welcome.)

Being open-source, Spinner also makes a great reference for creating your own
components. You're highly encouraged to take a peek inside to see how things
are set up. (Although I will say it's probably not the best code.)

Check out the demo at `tests/demo.nim` to see how it looks.

**Installation** - `nimble install spinner`

**Usage** - [Read the docs!](https://knaque.dev/spinner)

**NOTE**: Due to a [documented issue](https://github.com/treeform/flippy/issues/27)
with the Flippy library, components may have small visual artifacts at times.
When this is fixed, all you should need to do is download the latest version of
Flippy and/or Fidget.
